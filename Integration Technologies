DETAILED REPORT 

Introduction
- The increasing demand for graduates with practical cloud computing skills has urged universities to redesign curricula. This case study focuses on the collaboration between Queen Mary University of London and AWS Academy, which integrates theoretical concepts with industry-focused labs, aiming to bridge the gap between academia and industry.

Relevance of the study
- Pertinence to the Research Subject The topic of improving employability-focused curricula through industry engagement is closely related to this paper. It highlights how theoretical knowledge and practical skills may be integrated, demonstrating how collaborations like AWS Academy can meet the rising demand for graduates from higher education who are prepared for the workforce.

Summary of key findings
- Redesigning the curriculum: White papers and practical labs from the AWS Academy Cloud Foundations were incorporated into the course.
Development of Skills: Students gained both academic understanding and hands-on experience with cloud computing and Internet of Things applications. 
Exposure to the Industry: Experts from AWS presented career pathways, certifications, and internships to the students.

Critical analysis
Advantages: 
Hands-on Learning: Giving students access to real-world industrial tools enhanced their technical proficiency and preparedness for the workforce. 
Certification Readiness: Students' professional profiles were enhanced by the curriculum's alignment with AWS certifications. 
Enhanced Engagement: Resources developed by the industry improved academic achievement and student involvement.

Weaknesses: 
Dependency on AWS: Program sustainability is questioned when a program is dependent on just one industry partner. Narrow Scope: Greater applicability to other subjects or situations is limited by the concentration on a single institution and discipline.

Integration and synthesis
- Combining and Combining The advantages of combining scholarly theory with practical application are demonstrated by this study. It offers a paradigm that can be replicated by universities to form comparable collaborations in other fields, such data analytics or cybersecurity.
